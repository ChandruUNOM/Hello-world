          <p class="pad_bot2" align=”justify”>The Public Petition dated 11-11-1839 initiated the establishment of Madras University. 
		  It was in for January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its President, that the University Board was constituted. 
		  The University was organized in the model of London University. Madras University is the mother of almost all 
		  the old Universities of south India. University of Madras, state-controlled institution of higher learning located 
		  in Madras, India. One of three affiliating universities founded by the British in 1857, Madras has developed as a 
		  teaching and research institution since the 1920s. By the mid-1970s the university comprised 11 postgraduate faculties
		  and 22 constituent colleges and was the examining and degree-granting authority for 149 affiliated colleges throughout 
		  the state of Tamil Nadu. It is a national centre for advanced research in plant pathology, mathematical physics, biophysics, 
		  and Indian philosophy. Instruction is in English and Tamil.</p>
